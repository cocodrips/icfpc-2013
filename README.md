This repository contains the source code written and run by the team piyopiyo.py in ICFPC 2013. It contains two significant branches, namely:

* **master**: The main stream. The vast majority of our points were produced by the code here. It does not handle the inner fold (i.e. "fold" that is not "tfold") though.
* **fold**: The enhanced version for the inner fold. This branch was not merged into master to record this branch's code was run with slightly different parameters.

You probably want to explore the _fold_ branch: it contains all the code from the master (except for very minor changes), and the code added to support the inner fold at the last minute. That branch is set as the default.
